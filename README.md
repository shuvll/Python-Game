# Overview

I really wanted to create a game with Python. I am new to creating games, so I wanted the game that I was going to make simple.
I eventually chose Pong, which was a really fun game to make! Creating the game with Python made a lot of sense and was very easy for me.
Great first game to make, and lots of resources to learn how to do so.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Python to create the game. I also decided to use the Turtle directory for the game development.
I heard it was nice for beginners using Python to create games, so I tried it out. Everything in there made lots of sense and was great.
I also used Winsound to have a sound play for when the ball hits a surface.

# Future Work

* I would like to add a win screen when a player gets to a certain amount of points.
* I would like to add certain powerups that players could hit with the ball.
